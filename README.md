### What the project does:
This is a dating app where the user takes a survey of 10 questions and is paired up with the best match.

### Why the project is useful:
This project is great for the developers wanting to see an app that contains express, servers, jquery and DOM manipulation, and constructors all within the same app. This is helpful for the user to help find love!

### How users can get started with the project:
users can get started with the project by navigating to the home page.  There they will find a button taking them to the survey page where they will be prompted for their name, link to their photo, and a list of 10 questions to complete.  

After the questions have been answered, the user will then click the "make a love connection" button at the bottom of the screen.  They will then be matched with whichever person had the closest scores as the user.
